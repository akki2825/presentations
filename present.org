** Staying centered around what matters
**** Indigenous people represent 5% of the world’s population, but they speak two-thirds of the world’s 7,000–7,500 spoken languages. Of those languages, about one-third are in some stage of language loss (Lewis and Simon 2016), and as many as 90% are predicted to fall silent by century’s end (UNESCO Ad Hoc Expert Group 2003).
**** Arunachal Pradesh is one of the linguistically richest and most diverse regions in all of Asia. In part due to this high diversity, a Hindi-based creole has been rapidly sweeping the state in recent years.
**** This has led to the sudden and in some cases severe endangerment of several of the state’s indigenous languages (Modi et. al, 2006).

- Idu Mishmi is primarily used in Rural setting - Dibang Valley District of Arunachal Pradesh with some settlements in Lohit and E. Siang.
- However, the ‘Upper’ Idu (Luoba) live towards the Tibetan border and there are some villages in China (Sun 1983).
- The 1971 census recorded around 7700 individuals self-identifying as Idu Mishmi, although this is no measure of language competence.
