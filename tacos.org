** Who am I?
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="font-size: 50%; font-style: italic">“Who am I to blow against the wind?”</div>

 I am a Natural Language Processing Researcher, currently working as a Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter at the Department of English Language and Linguistics, Heinrich Heine University.

 I am non-Indigenous.

** Staying centered around what matters
**** Indigenous people represent 5% of the world’s population, but they speak two-thirds of the world’s 7,000–7,500 spoken languages. Of those languages, about one-third are in some stage of language loss (Lewis and Simon 2016), and as many as 90% are predicted to fall silent by century’s end (UNESCO Ad Hoc Expert Group 2003).
**** Arunachal Pradesh is one of the linguistically richest and most diverse regions in all of Asia. In part due to this high diversity, a Hindi-based creole has been rapidly sweeping the state in recent years.
**** This has led to the sudden and in some cases severe endangerment of several of the state’s indigenous languages (Modi et. al, 2006).

- Idu Mishmi is primarily used in Rural setting - Dibang Valley District of Arunachal Pradesh with some settlements in Lohit and E. Siang.
- However, the ‘Upper’ Idu (Luoba) live towards the Tibetan border and there are some villages in China (Sun 1983).
- Idu Mishmi belongs to Tibeto-Burman stock of Sino-Tibetan language family.
- The 1971 census recorded around 7700 individuals self-identifying as Idu Mishmi, although this is no measure of language competence.

** How it all began
- I was working as an Independent Researcher and was just drafting proposals after proposals to several indigenous communities in the Eastern-Himalayan Region.
- Thanks to Idu Mishmi Cultural and Literary Society (IMCLS) - the apex body of Idu Mishmi tribe for inviting to working on /something/..

** Little by little does the trick
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="font-size: 50%; font-style: italic">“There is no language for which nothing at all can be done” - Joshua Fishman</div>
*** A preliminary survey was conducted to assess the state of the language and how people of different age group really feel about using it.
*** The language is still spoken by a small group of older speakers within the community and the aim is to extend the use of the language into younger generations of speakers.
*** Several brainstorming sessions to obtain a long view of the revitalization process.

** Adapting to a Modern World
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="font-size: 50%; font-style: italic">Young speakers are the future of any language. If it survives, it will belong to them.</div>
*** Linguistic descriptions were first developed and published only in 2020 by Roger Blench et al.
*** Idu Mishmi language movement started with adapting Devanagari script in 1980s. Only recently in 2020, an IPA based script was developed by Dr. Roger Blench et al.
*** There is no written literature available.
*** Audio and Video recordings of Death Rituals, Folk tales, Marriage Ceremonies and other personal stories are available.

** A few more findings..
*** From the survey and personal experience it was clear that internet connectivity is very sparse but a lot of people owned smartphones.
*** So many Vloggers and K-Pop fans!
*** People in their 20s (and below) and a few in their 30s can’t talk fluent Idu Mishmi.
*** There are no higher education (above diploma) colleges in the area.

** Origin of E-dictionary
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 60%; font-size: 70%"><br>
- Primarily we set out to address the youth and children through technology for language learning.
- Dictionaries are of great help in learning a language.
- The ground work was done by Dr. Roger Blench team in procuring the Idu words in IPA-based script. We converted them to Roman and revalidated.
